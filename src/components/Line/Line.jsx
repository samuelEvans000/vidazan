          <h2>Discovery</h2>
          <p>
            Enzyme discovery marks the start of the journey for Novel Enzyme Development. Our low-risk concept starts with fully understanding your needs and processes, before identifying the appropriate gene sequence to perform an initial proof-of-concept fermentation of your new enzyme. As an Enzyme Development and Manufacturing Company, our overall aim is to partner with you towards a continuous supply of your desired Novel Enzyme at the right price.

            Biocatalysts can turn a concept into a reality by delivering a sample of active, soluble enzyme along with a technical summary and specification.

          <h2>Fermentation development and optimisation</h2>
          <p>
            Our focus in the development phase is on producing the maximum possible enzyme titre, purity, and yield. Now that the enzyme has been shown to perform as expected, the final stage involves making the product fit your commercial requirements.
